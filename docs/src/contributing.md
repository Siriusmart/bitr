# Contributing

If you are able and like the project so far, consider contributing through one of the following ways.

## Examples

Add your code to <a href="https://github.com/siriusmart/bitr/tree/master/examples" target=_blank>examples</a>, for that you can either <a href="https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request" target=_blank>*create a pull request*</a> or *contact me* through any ways (e.g. open an issue).

## Docs

If you've noticed any undocumented behavior that seems resonable, you can either *open a pull request* with the docs edited, or *contact me*. If you think it's a bug, open an issue.

## Adding features/fixing bugs

If you somehow managed to understand my code, it would be great if you can add features/fix bugs in Bitr. Open a pull request if you do.

Your code should **generate no warnings with `cargo clippy`**, unless there are strong reasons to write it not according to clippy.
